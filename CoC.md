# Introduction
This is the Cybersecurity Sacramento & DC916 Code of Conduct. It's a mixture of Code of Conduct's I (Kali - radicalkjax) have read from various other groups (DEF CON and not) that I felt best adhered to Cybersecurity Sacramento & DC916. If you have any questions at all you can reach out directly to [Leadership](https://dc916.com/Leadership) or submit them anonymously using the [provided form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAvA1sVB5_xy5_RFFwnP3ZBAAoc98rgiKZLcIY23bnHmV8qQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
